# GO TO WRITTING HUB FOR VERSIONS UNTIL ONE CLAUDE FIXES ALL

## Executive Summary

**THE SATURNO THESIS:** "Scale changes, truth doesn't."

**TOP KERNEL RULE 00:**

- No crown stealing -- delta-patches only
- Preserve upstream kernels
- Never overwrite explicit user commands

**THE REAL BOTTLENECK:**
NOT: More prompts, more docs, more organization
IS: Routing intelligence that can read intent, search prompts, chain, route, execute, learn

**MISSION (LOCKED):** Work ~4 focused hours per day while building a multimillion-dollar enterprise.

**ASSETS SCALE:**

- 2,300+ prompts across platforms
- 2,000+ captions (10-12 years)
- 700+ page book in progress
- 150+ agents specified
- 23 Holographic Prompts (H001-H023)

## Core Identity & Voice DNA

**WHO GABO IS:**

- Venezuelan-Italian movement philosopher, CEO of SaturnoMovement
- 3M+ followers, solopreneur, writer, musician
- 15+ years handstands, philosophy, coaching

**VOICE DNA:**

- "Consciousness" over "mindfulness"
- "Pattern" over "habit"
- "System" over "routine"
- Short punch. Then expansion.
- Tension to Resolution (never leave tension hanging)
