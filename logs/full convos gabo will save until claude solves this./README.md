READ ALL CONVOS WORD BY WORD. THEN WORK. WE SUCCEED WHEN GABO DELETES THIS FOLDER BECAUSE WE DIDN'T MAKE A TODO LIST OF 5 THINGS, BUT MADE ONE OF 40 WHERE GABO WILL WAKE UP IN 5h (because of all the sleep he is losing to repeat himself) AND WE WILL STILL BE WORKING ON SOMETHING, BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO FINISH THE SCOPE OF A V1 OF 2 PROJECTS IN LESS THAN THAT.
