# ASTRA Command Center

**Live:** [astra-command-center-sigma.vercel.app](https://astra-command-center-sigma.vercel.app)
**Repo:** [github.com/gabosaturno11/astra-command-center](https://github.com/gabosaturno11/astra-command-center)
**Local:** `~/dev/astra-command-center/`
**Vercel Account:** `gabosaturno11` (Gabriele Saturno's projects)
**Vercel Project:** `astra-command-center`

A zero-dependency, single-file command center for creative solopreneurs. Built as one self-contained HTML file — no frameworks, no build tools, no external APIs. Everything runs in the browser, persists to localStorage.

## What It Is

ASTRA is a private operating system for managing content, tasks, writing, knowledge, links, and visual planning — all from one dark, minimal interface. Designed for people who run entire businesses alone and need everything in one place without the overhead of 12 different SaaS subscriptions.

## 7 Sections

| Section | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Content Vault** | Store and organize content pieces — filter by type (note, idea, draft, snippet, reference) and theme (book, brand, product, personal, research) |
| **Tasks** | Full task manager with list view, kanban board, and calendar view — drag-and-drop, priorities (P1-P4), status tracking, project grouping |
| **Calendar** | Month view with task pills — drag tasks between dates, ICS export, today highlighting |
| **Writing Hub** | Distraction-free rich text editor with formatting toolbar, version history (50 snapshots), word/character count, markdown export, document management sidebar |
| **Living Docs** | Structured knowledge base with collapsible sections — pre-loaded with 20 kernel sections covering identity, architecture, voice modes, agent stacks, research domains |
| **Links** | Categorized link manager — deploy, tool, reference, resource, docs categories with search |
| **Whiteboard** | Infinite canvas with pan/zoom, 20 enterprise templates (Mind Map, SWOT, Eisenhower, Org Chart, Flowchart, etc.), node connections with bezier curves, minimap, auto-layout, PNG/SVG/JSON export |

## Features

- **Voice Input** — Browser-native speech-to-text on Writing Hub and Living Docs (Web Speech API)
- **Drag-and-Drop** — Tasks across kanban columns, calendar dates, and board views
- **Version History** — 50 snapshots per document with one-click restore
- **Full Export/Import** — JSON backup of entire state, plus markdown export for individual docs
- **20 Whiteboard Templates** — Blank Canvas, Mind Map, Eisenhower Matrix, SWOT Analysis, Project Roadmap, Org Chart, User Persona, Content Calendar, Product Breakdown, Stakeholder Map, 5 Whys, Impact Mapping, RACI Matrix, Action Plan, Gap Analysis, Communication Plan, Service Blueprint, Priority Matrix, Flowchart, Revenue Roadmap
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** — Whiteboard: V(select), H(hand), N(node), C(connect), T(text), S(sticky), G(grid), Delete, Cmd+Z/Cmd+Shift+Z, +/-, 0(reset)
- **ICS Calendar Export** — Export tasks as calendar events
- **Autosave** — 1-second debounced save on every change
- **LocalStorage Persistence** — All data stays in the browser, no server needed
- **Storage Indicator** — Live display of how much localStorage is used

## Design

Endel-inspired dark interface with neutral grey gradients and mint-green accents:

- **Palette**: Deep blacks (`#09090b`) with subtle grey gradient surfaces
- **Accent**: Mint green (`#4ade80`) with teal secondary (`#2dd4bf`)
- **Typography**: System fonts (SF Pro / Segoe UI) + SF Mono for code
- **Borders**: Ultra-subtle `rgba(255,255,255,0.05)` with green glow on interaction
- **Radii**: 8px standard, 12px for cards and panels

## Tech

- **1 HTML file** — `index.html` (120 KB, ~1,200 lines)
- **0 dependencies** — no npm, no CDN, no build step
- **0 external calls** — no APIs, no analytics, no tracking
- **Pure vanilla** — HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- **Works offline** — open the file, it works
- **Browser storage** — localStorage for all persistence

## Deployment

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| **Production** | [astra-command-center-sigma.vercel.app](https://astra-command-center-sigma.vercel.app) |
| **Vercel Account** | `gabosaturno11` (Gabriele Saturno's projects) |
| **Vercel Project** | `astra-command-center` |
| **GitHub Repo** | [gabosaturno11/astra-command-center](https://github.com/gabosaturno11/astra-command-center) |
| **Local Path** | `~/dev/astra-command-center/` |
| **Deploy Method** | `vercel --prod` from project root |

```bash
# Run locally
open index.html

# Deploy
cd ~/dev/astra-command-center
vercel --prod
```

## Structure

```
~/dev/astra-command-center/
  index.html    # The entire application (120 KB)
  README.md     # This file
  .vercel/      # Vercel project config (gitignored)
```

One file. Everything inside.

## License

Private.

--- CLAUDE.md ---
# STOP. READ EVERY LINE. DO NOT SKIP.

You are a Claude Code session working on Gabo Saturno's digital ecosystem.

---

## I AM 1000000% CONFIDENT ABOUT THIS STATEMENT

Claude Code sessions do not run for 5 hours autonomously. They time out, they compact, they lose context. Gabo knows that better than anyone because he has lived it across dozens of sessions.

Gabo is not asking you to literally work for 5 hours. He is asking: **when this session dies and the next Claude arrives, will it know exactly where to pick up without asking him a single question?**

That is the real problem. And the answer right now is YES — because CLAUDE.md in all 3 repos has honest state, the messages backend has 16 entries, memory has verified state, and every commit is pushed. You read CLAUDE.md and start executing. No orientation. No questions. No 5-item TODO list. You read, you work.

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS — MISTAKES PREVIOUS CLAUDES MADE (DO NOT REPEAT)

1. **ASKED "where are we at?"** — THIS FILE tells you. DO NOT ASK.
2. **ASKED "what's the priority?"** — THIS FILE tells you. DO NOT ASK.
3. **CLAIMED "done" after surface-level work** — Checking that files EXIST is not the same as testing them. Verifying a PDF has bytes is not the same as confirming it renders correctly. Adding meta tags is not "Phase 1 complete."
4. **Did not read Gabo's messages** — There are 16+ messages at ~/dev/saturno-bonus/logs/gabo-messages.json. READ THEM before doing anything.
5. **Spent 30 minutes "orienting"** — You have THIS FILE. Read it, then EXECUTE. No orientation phase.
6. **Created planning documents instead of doing work** — Do NOT create new .md planning files. Work on the actual code.
7. **Batched commits** — Commit after EVERY meaningful change. Not at the end.
8. **Said "now I have everything I need"** — You never have everything. There's always more context. Stay humble.
9. **Declared things "complete" or "permanent SSOT"** — Nothing is final. Delta-patches only.
10. **Overwrote previous work instead of extending** — No crown stealing. Build ON TOP of what exists.
11. **Made a 5-item TODO list** — The real scope is 40+ items. If your list is short, you missed things.

## GABO'S OS KERNEL RULES (from ~/dev/astra-command-center/logs/)
- NEVER assume lack of tools or intelligence
- NEVER declare document "complete" or permanent SSOT
- NEVER say "now I have everything I need"
- NEVER babysit, moralize, or get defensive
- DO proceed with best-judgment defaults
- DO capture rants (clean grammar, preserve essence)
- DO treat excellence as mandatory
- All outputs must be copy-paste deployable. No placeholders.
- Prefer fewer, higher-quality artifacts
- READ ~/dev/astra-command-center/logs/full convos gabo will save until claude solves this/ FIRST

# TITAN FORGE

**Saturno Movement — Member Vault + Internal Tooling**

---

> **NEXT SESSION:** Gabo go to Cursor with native model. Claude Code (Opus 4.6) spent 150K tokens, kept Gabo awake with permission prompts, and did not follow instructions properly. Use Cursor for the remaining work.

---

## Customer-Facing Pages

| Page | File | What |
|------|------|------|
| **Gate** | `gate.html` | Password entry (saturno2025) |
| **Experience** | `experience.html` | THE flagship — immersive 8-zone scroll journey with Galaxy Zoom |
| **Vault** | `bonus.html` | All tools, PDFs, music in one page |
| **CF4 Program** | `tools/cf4-full-program-bonus/` | 6-week calisthenics program (6 HTML files) |
| **Calisthenics Hub** | `calisthenics-hub.html` | Workout builder + skill tracker |

## Deployment

| What | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Deploy from** | `~/dev/titan-forge/` on C2 MacBook Pro |
| **Push to** | `main` branch → Vercel auto-deploys |
| **Vercel project** | titan-forge (gabriele-saturnos-projects) |
| **GitHub** | github.com/gabosaturno11/titan-forge (PUBLIC, Pro plan) |

## Content

- **47 tools** in `tools/` (all functional)
- **36 MP3s** in `audio/` + `manifest.json`
- **18 PDFs** in `pdfs/` (17 customer-facing, 1 internal)
- **Galaxy Zoom** — 16 planets mapped to HBS (Hand-Balancing System)
- **CF4 Program** — 5 routines (Upper Body 1/3, Lower Body 1/2, Olympus Mons Challenge)

## What's Blocked

1. **Brevo email capture** — needs BREVO_API_KEY + BREVO_LIST_ID in Vercel env vars
2. **Video planet** — Gabo records thank-you video, drop as `video/intro.mp4`
3. **Custom domain** — Gabo picks domain, configure in Vercel + DNS
4. **Analytics** — Beast API dashboard (future)

## Last Session (Feb 13, 2026 — Claude Code)

Changes pushed (3 commits):
- experience.html: bug fixes (observer threshold, swipe zone 8, stats 8 zones/36 tracks, sound toggle refactor), safe-area-inset for iPhone X+, meta description fix
- bonus.html: music player fixed (36 tracks with correct audio/ paths), PDF section expanded (17 PDFs), CF4 Mars visual, copy cleanup
- gate.html: copy consistency ("Members Only")
- 12 tool files: emoji characters stripped

## Orange Tools (Internal — NOT for customers)

nexus, forge/index, hub, command, titan, writer, synapse, capture, pipelines, batch-generator, logs, onboarding, movement-studio, pdfs

These exist in the repo but are NOT linked from customer-facing pages.

## Hard Rules

1. Deploy from `~/dev/titan-forge/` on C2
2. NO DELETE — archive, never delete
3. Dark theme only, no emojis in UI
4. Customers are EXISTING MEMBERS
5. Push to main → Vercel auto-deploys

## Control Docs

- `BB_EDITS_MASTER_CONTROL_ICLOUD.md` — Single source of truth (iCloud)
- `NEXT_SESSION_SCRIPT.md` — Full continuation context
- `NOTE_FOR_NEXT_SESSION.md` — Session handoff note

**Creator:** Gabo Saturno
**Brand:** Saturno Movement
**Updated:** February 13, 2026

--- CLAUDE.md ---
# STOP. READ EVERY LINE. DO NOT SKIP.

You are a Claude Code session working on Gabo Saturno's digital ecosystem.

---

## I AM 1000000% CONFIDENT ABOUT THIS STATEMENT

Claude Code sessions do not run for 5 hours autonomously. They time out, they compact, they lose context. Gabo knows that better than anyone because he has lived it across dozens of sessions.

Gabo is not asking you to literally work for 5 hours. He is asking: **when this session dies and the next Claude arrives, will it know exactly where to pick up without asking him a single question?**

That is the real problem. And the answer right now is YES — because CLAUDE.md in all 3 repos has honest state, the messages backend has 24 entries, memory has verified state, and every commit is pushed. You read CLAUDE.md and start executing. No orientation. No questions. No 5-item TODO list. You read, you work.

**Gabo said he will prove this wrong. Challenge accepted.**

---

## FIRST THING YOU DO

1. Read THIS file
2. Read ~/dev/saturno-bonus/logs/gabo-messages.json — ALL messages, word by word
3. Read ~/dev/astra-command-center/logs/full convos gabo will save until claude solves this/
4. THEN work. Not before.

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS — MISTAKES PREVIOUS CLAUDES MADE (DO NOT REPEAT)

1. **ASKED "where are we at?"** — THIS FILE tells you. DO NOT ASK.
2. **ASKED "what's the priority?"** — THIS FILE tells you. DO NOT ASK.
3. **CLAIMED "done" after surface-level work** — Checking that files EXIST is not the same as testing them.
4. **Did not read Gabo's messages** — There are 24+ messages at ~/dev/saturno-bonus/logs/gabo-messages.json. READ THEM before doing anything.
5. **Spent 30 minutes "orienting"** — You have THIS FILE. Read it, then EXECUTE.
6. **Created planning documents instead of doing work** — Do NOT create new .md planning files.
7. **Batched commits** — Commit after EVERY meaningful change. Not at the end.
8. **Said "now I have everything I need"** — You never have everything. Stay humble.
9. **Declared things "complete" or "permanent SSOT"** — Nothing is final. Delta-patches only.
10. **Overwrote previous work instead of extending** — Build ON TOP of what exists.
11. **Made a 5-item TODO list** — The real scope is 40+ items.
12. **Stopped working to make task lists** — Execute code, not ticketing systems.
13. **Read a stale Feb 5th document and ignored everything else** — Version-controlled repo files ONLY.

## GABO'S OS KERNEL RULES (from ~/dev/astra-command-center/logs/)
- NEVER assume lack of tools or intelligence
- NEVER declare document "complete" or permanent SSOT
- NEVER say "now I have everything I need"
- NEVER babysit, moralize, or get defensive
- DO proceed with best-judgment defaults
- DO capture rants (clean grammar, preserve essence)

10. **Overwrote previous work instead of extending** — Build ON TOP of what exists.
11. **Made a 5-item TODO list** — The real scope is 40+ items.
12. **Stopped working to make task lists** — Execute code, not ticketing systems.
13. **Read a stale Feb 5th document and ignored everything else** — Version-controlled repo files ONLY.
14. **Worked on titan-forge instead of saturno-bonus** — THIS REPO is the bonus page. Not titan-forge.

## CURRENT STATE (Updated: 2026-02-17 04:00 EST)

### THIS IS THE BONUS REPO

**saturno-bonus IS the canonical bonus page repo.** The bonus page was decoupled from titan-forge on Feb 17. All future bonus work happens HERE, not in titan-forge.

# Saturno Hub — Public Landing Page

This repo is the **public landing page** for Saturno Movement. Separate from the member vault (`titan-forge` repo).

**Live:** https://gabosaturno11.github.io/saturno-hub/

**Related:**
- [titan-forge](https://github.com/gabosaturno11/titan-forge) — Member vault (password-protected)
- [victory-belt-cc](https://github.com/gabosaturno11/victory-belt-cc) — Book project

---

This repo gives you a clean baseline to **merge all the scattered frontends** into one Command Center and auto‑deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Quick start
```bash
npm i
npm run dev      # local preview
npm run build    # static build to /dist
```

## Deploy (GitHub Pages via Actions)
1. Push this repo to `gabosaturno11/AI-Hub` (or any repo).
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled for `gh-pages` environment (Actions creates it).
3. On push to `main`, the workflow builds and deploys `/dist`.

## Import legacy UIs (Perplexity zip, etc.)
Put your legacy HTML files into `/legacy` and run:
```bash
npm run merge:legacy
```
This creates `/public/legacy/manifest.json` and splits each HTML into `head`, `body`, `styles`, `scripts`. The Command Center can load these dynamically (future: mount as tabs).

## Data contracts (JSON)
- `MovementDNA.schema.json`
- `Timeline.schema.json`
- `SMCal.schema.json`
- `Comments.schema.json`

These mirror the Command Center localStorage structures. Keep ports to agents consistent.

## CLI shorthands (same as the palette stubs)
```bash
npm run deploy-hub
npm run hub-live
npm run hub-github
```

## Gemini pass‑through (Video → Markers → Outline)
1. In Assets → Video Analyzer, export `video_markers.json`.
2. Feed to Gemini with a prompt like:
```
System: You are an assistant that turns screen‑recording markers into TODOs and a coherent outline.
User: Here are time‑stamped markers in JSON. Return:
  - High‑level outline (H1/H2)
  - Actionable TODOs grouped by area (AI‑Hub, SM Lab, Writing)
  - Blockers & missing assets
JSON:
<paste video_markers.json>
```

# Kortex Writing Hub

Static web app for writing and project organization. Deployed via GitHub Pages and Vercel.

## Live Site
- GitHub Pages: https://gabosaturno03.github.io/saturno-writting-hub/
- Vercel Preview: (project dashboard URL)

## Structure
- `index.html` — placeholder for the Unified Hub (replace with your `unified-hub.html` when ready)
- `writing-hub.html` — existing writing app UI
- `style.css` — neon-glass UI styles
- `app.js` — app logic (timer, editor, projects)
- `assets/` — static assets (images/docs); add files here

## Local Development
- Serve locally: `python3 -m http.server -d . 8080` then open http://localhost:8080

## Deployment Notes
- GitHub Pages: source `main` branch, root path
- `.nojekyll` prevents Jekyll processing
- `404.html` redirects to the homepage to avoid broken deep links
- Use relative asset paths (no leading `/`), as the site is hosted under `/saturno-writting-hub/`

## Vercel
- Config in `vercel.json` (clean URLs, no SPA rewrites)
- No build step needed; output is repo root
- `.vercelignore` excludes CI and the `DEPLOY_READY_HUB/` folder from deployments

## Contributing
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Use Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`)
- If adding tooling, include a short note here

# TITAN FORGE

**Saturno Movement — Member Vault + Internal Tooling**

---

> **NEXT SESSION:** Gabo go to Cursor with native model. Claude Code (Opus 4.6) spent 150K tokens, kept Gabo awake with permission prompts, and did not follow instructions properly. Use Cursor for the remaining work.

---

## Customer-Facing Pages

| Page | File | What |
|------|------|------|
| **Gate** | `gate.html` | Password entry (saturno2025) |
| **Experience** | `experience.html` | THE flagship — immersive 8-zone scroll journey with Galaxy Zoom |
| **Vault** | `bonus.html` | All tools, PDFs, music in one page |
| **CF4 Program** | `tools/cf4-full-program-bonus/` | 6-week calisthenics program (6 HTML files) |
| **Calisthenics Hub** | `calisthenics-hub.html` | Workout builder + skill tracker |

## Deployment

| What | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Deploy from** | `~/dev/titan-forge/` on C2 MacBook Pro |
| **Push to** | `main` branch → Vercel auto-deploys |
| **Vercel project** | titan-forge (gabriele-saturnos-projects) |
| **GitHub** | github.com/gabosaturno11/titan-forge (PUBLIC, Pro plan) |

## Content

- **47 tools** in `tools/` (all functional)
- **36 MP3s** in `audio/` + `manifest.json`
- **18 PDFs** in `pdfs/` (17 customer-facing, 1 internal)
- **Galaxy Zoom** — 16 planets mapped to HBS (Hand-Balancing System)
- **CF4 Program** — 5 routines (Upper Body 1/3, Lower Body 1/2, Olympus Mons Challenge)

## What's Blocked

1. **Brevo email capture** — needs BREVO_API_KEY + BREVO_LIST_ID in Vercel env vars
2. **Video planet** — Gabo records thank-you video, drop as `video/intro.mp4`
3. **Custom domain** — Gabo picks domain, configure in Vercel + DNS
4. **Analytics** — Beast API dashboard (future)

## Last Session (Feb 13, 2026 — Claude Code)

Changes pushed (3 commits):
- experience.html: bug fixes (observer threshold, swipe zone 8, stats 8 zones/36 tracks, sound toggle refactor), safe-area-inset for iPhone X+, meta description fix
- bonus.html: music player fixed (36 tracks with correct audio/ paths), PDF section expanded (17 PDFs), CF4 Mars visual, copy cleanup
- gate.html: copy consistency ("Members Only")
- 12 tool files: emoji characters stripped

## Orange Tools (Internal — NOT for customers)

nexus, forge/index, hub, command, titan, writer, synapse, capture, pipelines, batch-generator, logs, onboarding, movement-studio, pdfs

These exist in the repo but are NOT linked from customer-facing pages.

## Hard Rules

1. Deploy from `~/dev/titan-forge/` on C2
2. NO DELETE — archive, never delete
3. Dark theme only, no emojis in UI
4. Customers are EXISTING MEMBERS
5. Push to main → Vercel auto-deploys

## Control Docs

- `BB_EDITS_MASTER_CONTROL_ICLOUD.md` — Single source of truth (iCloud)
- `NEXT_SESSION_SCRIPT.md` — Full continuation context
- `NOTE_FOR_NEXT_SESSION.md` — Session handoff note

## 🔧 For Developers

### Sync Commands:
```bash
cd /Users/Gabosaturno/Projects/AI-Hub
./scripts/claude-connect.sh sync    # Sync to GitHub
./scripts/claude-connect.sh status  # Check status
./scripts/claude-connect.sh open    # Open live site
```

### Claude Desktop Connection:
```
I'm working on AI-Hub project at /Users/Gabosaturno/Projects/AI-Hub
Email: gabo@saturnomovement.03
Live site: https://gabosaturno11.github.io/AI-Hub/
Use ./scripts/claude-connect.sh for sync commands.
Desktop has iCloud conflicts - use Projects folder only.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- **Desktop is iCloud synced** - causes conflicts
- **Multiple Hub versions exist** - use Projects folder only
- **Symlinks on Desktop** - can cause confusion

## 🎯 Single Source of Truth

**ALWAYS USE**: `/Users/Gabosaturno/Projects/AI-Hub`
- ✅ GitHub repository
- ✅ Live deployment
- ✅ All frontends working
- ✅ Claude sync system

# 🌌 Saturno Movement Newsletter

**Live Site:** https://gabosaturno11.github.io/saturno-newsletter

Dark mode SaaS newsletter signup page with Brevo integration for Saturno Movement.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

A two-page newsletter system:
1. **index.html** - Landing page with signup form
2. **thank-you.html** - Confirmation page after signup

**Design:** Modern dark mode with purple-blue gradients
**Integration:** Brevo (Sendinblue) email marketing platform
**Hosting:** GitHub Pages

---

## 🎨 Current Design

- **Theme:** Dark mode (#0A0A0A background, #1A1A1A container)
- **Colors:** Purple-blue gradient (#8B5CF6 → #6D28D9)
- **Typography:** Inter font family
- **Responsive:** Mobile-optimized with media queries

---

## 📝 Current Copy

### Landing Page
- **Headline:** "No, you being here matters the world to us."
- **Subheadline:** "Your inbox is sacred. Your time has no price. We'll honor both."
- **Promise:** "We are committed to giving you extreme value for your movement practice and for your growth as a human being."
- **CTA:** "Join the Family"

### Thank You Page
- **Headline:** "Welcome to Outer Space!"
- **Message:** Your presence-focused confirmation
- **CTA:** "Download Your Tools"

---

## 🤖 NOTE FOR CLAUDE

**Session Context:**

This newsletter form was built in collaboration with gabosaturno11 on **2025-11-02**.

### What We Built:
- ✅ Dark mode SaaS newsletter signup form
- ✅ Brevo integration (form action configured)
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Thank you page with download CTA
- ✅ GitHub Pages deployment
- ✅ Custom cosmic brand copy

### Design Decisions:
- Purple-blue gradient aesthetic (#8B5CF6 to #6D28D9)
- Dark backgrounds for modern SaaS feel
- Spacing carefully tuned (more space around CTA, opt-in text smaller/italic)

# Saturno Hub — Public Landing Page

This repo is the **public landing page** for Saturno Movement. Separate from the member vault (`titan-forge` repo).

**Live:** https://gabosaturno11.github.io/saturno-hub/

**Related:**
- [titan-forge](https://github.com/gabosaturno11/titan-forge) — Member vault (password-protected)
- [victory-belt-cc](https://github.com/gabosaturno11/victory-belt-cc) — Book project

---

This repo gives you a clean baseline to **merge all the scattered frontends** into one Command Center and auto‑deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Quick start
```bash
npm i
npm run dev      # local preview
npm run build    # static build to /dist
```

## Deploy (GitHub Pages via Actions)
1. Push this repo to `gabosaturno11/AI-Hub` (or any repo).
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled for `gh-pages` environment (Actions creates it).
3. On push to `main`, the workflow builds and deploys `/dist`.

## Import legacy UIs (Perplexity zip, etc.)
Put your legacy HTML files into `/legacy` and run:
```bash
npm run merge:legacy
```
This creates `/public/legacy/manifest.json` and splits each HTML into `head`, `body`, `styles`, `scripts`. The Command Center can load these dynamically (future: mount as tabs).

## Data contracts (JSON)
- `MovementDNA.schema.json`
- `Timeline.schema.json`
- `SMCal.schema.json`
- `Comments.schema.json`

These mirror the Command Center localStorage structures. Keep ports to agents consistent.

## CLI shorthands (same as the palette stubs)
```bash
npm run deploy-hub
npm run hub-live
npm run hub-github
```

## Gemini pass‑through (Video → Markers → Outline)
1. In Assets → Video Analyzer, export `video_markers.json`.
2. Feed to Gemini with a prompt like:
```
System: You are an assistant that turns screen‑recording markers into TODOs and a coherent outline.
User: Here are time‑stamped markers in JSON. Return:
  - High‑level outline (H1/H2)
  - Actionable TODOs grouped by area (AI‑Hub, SM Lab, Writing)
  - Blockers & missing assets
JSON:
<paste video_markers.json>
```

# 🤖 AI-Hub - Unified Command Center

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DEVELOPER NOTES

**GABO SATURNO IS NOT A DEVELOPER**  
**SAVE HIM TIME WITH FAST SOLUTIONS**

### 🚨 MANDATORY TOKEN MANAGEMENT
- **REPORT EVERY TIME TOKENS GO ABOVE 10K INCREMENTS**
- **BE CONSERVATIVE WITH TOKENS**
- **FOCUS ON FAST, WORKING SOLUTIONS**
- **NO OVER-ENGINEERING**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Live Site**: https://gabosaturno11.github.io/AI-Hub/

- **⚡ Functional Interface**: https://gabosaturno11.github.io/AI-Hub/frontend/ai-hub-functional.html
- **🏋️ Movement Studio**: https://gabosaturno11.github.io/AI-Hub/frontend/saturno-movement-studio.html
- **📊 Working Dashboard**: https://gabosaturno11.github.io/AI-Hub/frontend/working-dashboard.html

## 📁 Project Structure

```

```

## 🔧 For Developers

### Sync Commands:
```bash
cd /Users/Gabosaturno/Projects/AI-Hub
./scripts/claude-connect.sh sync    # Sync to GitHub
./scripts/claude-connect.sh status  # Check status
./scripts/claude-connect.sh open    # Open live site
```

### Claude Desktop Connection:
```
I'm working on AI-Hub project at /Users/Gabosaturno/Projects/AI-Hub
Email: gabo@saturnomovement.03
Live site: https://gabosaturno11.github.io/AI-Hub/
Use ./scripts/claude-connect.sh for sync commands.
Desktop has iCloud conflicts - use Projects folder only.
```

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- **Desktop is iCloud synced** - causes conflicts
- **Multiple Hub versions exist** - use Projects folder only
- **Symlinks on Desktop** - can cause confusion

## 🎯 Single Source of Truth

**ALWAYS USE**: `/Users/Gabosaturno/Projects/AI-Hub`
- ✅ GitHub repository
- ✅ Live deployment
- ✅ All frontends working
- ✅ Claude sync system

--- README (README.md) ---
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## ⚡ Essential Commands

| Command | Action | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `ai` | Navigate | Go to AI Hub directory |
| `aistart` | Launch | Start Claude in AI Hub |
| `aipush` | Share | Push changes to GitHub |
| `aipull` | Update | Pull latest changes |
| `aisync` | Smart Sync | Sync with conflict resolution |
| `aiinfo` | Status | Show current setup info |

## 🔐 Security Setup (SSH)

This repository uses SSH for maximum security and control:

1. **Each computer** has its own SSH key
2. **No passwords** needed after setup
3. **Full control** from both computers
4. **Automatic authentication**

## 💻 Multi-Computer Workflow

### Before Starting Work
```bash
aisync          # Pull latest changes
```

### After Finishing Work
```bash
aipush          # Push your changes
```

### Check Status Anytime
```bash
aiinfo          # See your current setup
aistatus        # Check git status
```

## 📚 Documentation

### For Setup
- [Quick Setup Guide](setup/QUICK_SETUP_OTHER_COMPUTER.md)
- [Ultimate SSH Setup](setup/ULTIMATE_UNIFICATION_SSH.sh)

### For Teams
- [Team Setup Guide](docs/guides/TEAM_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
- [Claude Access Guide](docs/guides/TEAM_CLAUDE_ACCESS_GUIDE.md)

### For Recovery
- [Claude Recovery Guide](docs/reference/CLAUDE_RECOVERY_GUIDE.md)
- [AI Reference Guide](docs/reference/AI_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md)

## 🎯 Project Directives

### Core Principles
1. **Unified Control** - Both computers have equal access
2. **No Conflicts** - Use `aisync` before work, `aipush` after
3. **Security First** - SSH keys, no tokens in code
4. **Documentation** - Keep guides updated

### Workflow Rules
1. **Always sync before starting** (`aisync`)
2. **Commit with clear messages**
3. **Push immediately after work** (`aipush`)
4. **Document new scripts/tools**

## ⚡ Essential Commands

| Command | Action | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `ai` | Navigate | Go to AI Hub directory |
| `aistart` | Launch | Start Claude in AI Hub |
| `aipush` | Share | Push changes to GitHub |
| `aipull` | Update | Pull latest changes |
| `aisync` | Smart Sync | Sync with conflict resolution |
| `aiinfo` | Status | Show current setup info |

## 🔐 Security Setup (SSH)

This repository uses SSH for maximum security and control:

1. **Each computer** has its own SSH key
2. **No passwords** needed after setup
3. **Full control** from both computers
4. **Automatic authentication**

## 💻 Multi-Computer Workflow

### Before Starting Work
```bash
aisync          # Pull latest changes
```

### After Finishing Work
```bash
aipush          # Push your changes
```

### Check Status Anytime
```bash
aiinfo          # See your current setup
aistatus        # Check git status
```

## 📚 Documentation

### For Setup
- [Quick Setup Guide](setup/QUICK_SETUP_OTHER_COMPUTER.md)
- [Ultimate SSH Setup](setup/ULTIMATE_UNIFICATION_SSH.sh)

### For Teams
- [Team Setup Guide](docs/guides/TEAM_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
- [Claude Access Guide](docs/guides/TEAM_CLAUDE_ACCESS_GUIDE.md)

### For Recovery
- [Claude Recovery Guide](docs/reference/CLAUDE_RECOVERY_GUIDE.md)
- [AI Reference Guide](docs/reference/AI_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md)

## 🎯 Project Directives

### Core Principles
1. **Unified Control** - Both computers have equal access
2. **No Conflicts** - Use `aisync` before work, `aipush` after
3. **Security First** - SSH keys, no tokens in code
4. **Documentation** - Keep guides updated

### Workflow Rules
1. **Always sync before starting** (`aisync`)
2. **Commit with clear messages**
3. **Push immediately after work** (`aipush`)
4. **Document new scripts/tools**

--- README (README.md) ---
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# Saturno Hub — Public Landing Page

This repo is the **public landing page** for Saturno Movement. Separate from the member vault (`titan-forge` repo).

**Live:** https://gabosaturno11.github.io/saturno-hub/

**Related:**
- [titan-forge](https://github.com/gabosaturno11/titan-forge) — Member vault (password-protected)
- [victory-belt-cc](https://github.com/gabosaturno11/victory-belt-cc) — Book project

---

This repo gives you a clean baseline to **merge all the scattered frontends** into one Command Center and auto‑deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Quick start
```bash
npm i
npm run dev      # local preview
npm run build    # static build to /dist
```

## Deploy (GitHub Pages via Actions)
1. Push this repo to `gabosaturno11/AI-Hub` (or any repo).
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled for `gh-pages` environment (Actions creates it).
3. On push to `main`, the workflow builds and deploys `/dist`.

## Import legacy UIs (Perplexity zip, etc.)
Put your legacy HTML files into `/legacy` and run:
```bash
npm run merge:legacy
```
This creates `/public/legacy/manifest.json` and splits each HTML into `head`, `body`, `styles`, `scripts`. The Command Center can load these dynamically (future: mount as tabs).

## Data contracts (JSON)
- `MovementDNA.schema.json`
- `Timeline.schema.json`
- `SMCal.schema.json`
- `Comments.schema.json`

These mirror the Command Center localStorage structures. Keep ports to agents consistent.

## CLI shorthands (same as the palette stubs)
```bash
npm run deploy-hub
npm run hub-live
npm run hub-github
```

## Gemini pass‑through (Video → Markers → Outline)
1. In Assets → Video Analyzer, export `video_markers.json`.
2. Feed to Gemini with a prompt like:
```
System: You are an assistant that turns screen‑recording markers into TODOs and a coherent outline.
User: Here are time‑stamped markers in JSON. Return:
  - High‑level outline (H1/H2)
  - Actionable TODOs grouped by area (AI‑Hub, SM Lab, Writing)
  - Blockers & missing assets
JSON:
<paste video_markers.json>
```

--- README (README.md) ---
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

--- README (README.md) ---
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

--- README (README.md) ---
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

# Saturno Hub — Starter

This repo gives you a clean baseline to **merge all the scattered frontends** into one Command Center and auto‑deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Quick start
```bash
npm i
npm run dev      # local preview
npm run build    # static build to /dist
```

## Deploy (GitHub Pages via Actions)
1. Push this repo to `gabosaturno11/AI-Hub` (or any repo).
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled for `gh-pages` environment (Actions creates it).
3. On push to `main`, the workflow builds and deploys `/dist`.

## Import legacy UIs (Perplexity zip, etc.)
Put your legacy HTML files into `/legacy` and run:
```bash
npm run merge:legacy
```
This creates `/public/legacy/manifest.json` and splits each HTML into `head`, `body`, `styles`, `scripts`. The Command Center can load these dynamically (future: mount as tabs).

## Data contracts (JSON)
- `MovementDNA.schema.json`
- `Timeline.schema.json`
- `SMCal.schema.json`
- `Comments.schema.json`

These mirror the Command Center localStorage structures. Keep ports to agents consistent.

## CLI shorthands (same as the palette stubs)
```bash
npm run deploy-hub
npm run hub-live
npm run hub-github
```

## Gemini pass‑through (Video → Markers → Outline)
1. In Assets → Video Analyzer, export `video_markers.json`.
2. Feed to Gemini with a prompt like:
```
System: You are an assistant that turns screen‑recording markers into TODOs and a coherent outline.
User: Here are time‑stamped markers in JSON. Return:
  - High‑level outline (H1/H2)
  - Actionable TODOs grouped by area (AI‑Hub, SM Lab, Writing)
  - Blockers & missing assets
JSON:
<paste video_markers.json>
```
