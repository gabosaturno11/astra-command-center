# ASTRA V2 — Session Log (Feb 15, 2026)
**Session:** Claude Opus 4.6
**Duration:** ~2.5 hours (planning + build)
**Trigger:** Gabo's request to add Grok-style project management to ASTRA

---

## WHAT WAS BUILT

### ASTRA V1 -> V2 Upgrade (index.html: 1,198 -> 2,080 lines)

**New Systems:**

1. **Projects as First-Class Entities**
   - Full CRUD (create, edit, archive)
   - Each project has: name, icon, color, status, instructions (rich text)
   - Sidebar section with project list, badge counts, new project button
   - Clicking a project opens a tabbed detail view

2. **Project Detail View (5 Tabs)**
   - **Instructions** — contenteditable rich text editor with auto-save (debounced 500ms)
   - **Living Docs** — filtered to project scope, can create new ones inline
   - **Knowledge Base** — grid of document cards, search, add/edit/delete
   - **Tasks** — filtered to project scope, can add tasks inline
   - **Links** — filtered to project scope, can add links inline

3. **Knowledge Base System**
   - 4 input types: Text/Markdown, File Reference, URL, Image (paste from clipboard)
   - Cards show type badge, name, description, tags
   - Full viewer modal with content display, image preview, file path links
   - Search/filter across all KB items
   - Items are draggable to whiteboard (creates linked nodes)

4. **Icon Picker (60+ SVG Icons)**
   - Grok-style popup grid with 8 categories
   - General, Tech, Creative, Business, Science, People, Objects, Arrows/Shapes
   - All inline SVG (zero external dependencies)
   - Used in project creation, sidebar rendering, detail view

5. **Whiteboard KB Integration**
   - KB items get a drag handle
   - Drop on whiteboard creates a node linked to the KB item
   - Node shows type badge, name, description
   - If image: shows thumbnail as node background

6. **Undo Import**
   - Auto-backup before every JSON import
   - "Undo Import" button in sidebar footer
   - Restores full state from backup

7. **Pre-Seeded Projects (5)**
   - SM App Rebuild (purple, rocket icon) — full developer situation, rebuild timeline, tech stack
   - Saturno Bonus (green, gift icon) — repo structure, deploy info, shipping plan
   - Book AOC (amber, book icon) — Victory Belt, $20K advance
   - HBS Program (cyan, target icon) — handbalancing system
   - De Aqui a Saturno (pink, heart icon) — Valentine's experience

## GABO MESSAGES SAVED (This Session)

All saved to `~/dev/saturno-bonus/logs/gabo-messages.json`:
- #4: ASTRA upgrade request (project hub, document system, deployment control)
- #5: Knowledge Base + Documents in Projects + Whiteboard Drag
- #6: Save specs to repo, organize docs, create session log
- #7: GO signal — "lets BUILD! full autonomous"

---

## DESIGN DECISIONS

1. **Single HTML file preserved** — no external dependencies, zero CDN
2. **localStorage-based** — projects + KB use ~15-20KB per project, well within 5-10MB limit
3. **Project panel overlays main content** — not inside the `.app` container, fills the content area
4. **Image paste uses Clipboard API** — stored as base64 data URL if < 500KB
5. **KB drag to whiteboard** uses native HTML5 drag and drop with `kb:` prefix in dataTransfer
6. **Pre-seeded content runs once** — checks if `S.projects.length` before seeding
7. **Undo Import** stores backup in separate localStorage key (`_backup` suffix)

---

## KNOWN ISSUES / NEXT STEPS

1. **Images > 500KB** — currently stored full-size as base64. Should warn user or auto-resize.
2. **Project color** not yet used for tab accent — all tabs still mint-green.
3. **Living Docs assignment** — existing standalone docs can't yet be "moved" to a project post-creation.
4. **Mobile responsiveness** — project view tabs may need horizontal scroll on small screens.
5. **Export size** — if many images stored, export JSON could be very large.

## CRITICAL NOTE FOR NEXT SESSION

**TOMORROW (Feb 16) = BONUS PAGE PRIORITY**
- Not ASTRA, not developer call
- Gabo said: "tomorrows priority is THE BONUS page. not astra, no developer."
- The bonus page repo is at `~/dev/saturno-bonus/`
- It needs: PDFs, CF4 calendar, email capture (Brevo), music player CDN solution
